# KeyboardStateEvents

Get notified through LiveData when Keyboard is open or closed

## Getting started

The first step is to include KeyboardStateEvents into your project, for example, as a Gradle compile dependency:

```groovy
implementation 'com.github.guilhe:keyboard-state-events:${LATEST_VERSION}'
```
[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.github.guilhe/keyboard-state-events/badge.svg)](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.github.guilhe%20AND%20keyboard-state-events) [![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/gdelgado/androidKey/boardStateEvents/images/download.svg)](https://bintray.com/gdelgado/android/KeyboardStateEvents/_latestVersion)

## Sample usage

Call `bindKeyboardStateEvents()` in you `AppCompatActivity` or `FragmentActivity` and observe `KeyboardLiveData.state` to get notified:
```java
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

      override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        ...
        KeyboardLiveData.state.observe(this, Observer {...})
        bindKeyboardStateEvents()
    }
}
```
Just that and you're done! ðŸ˜Ž

Also, some handy extension functions:  
```java
ComponentActivity.toggleKeyboard()
ComponentActivity.dismissKeyboard()
ComponentActivity.isKeyboardOpen()
ViewGroup.isKeyboardOpen()
```
